* **Version:** Assign a version number to your application.&#x20;
* **Template:** Choose a template that aligns with your application's requirements from the dropdown list.&#x20;
* **Type:** Select the type that suits your use case from the dropdown list. For example, if your application involves orchestrating workflows and Change Data Capture (CDC), choose the corresponding option.
* **Tags:** Add relevant tags that describe your application's functionalities. These tags will help categorize and identify your application. Choose tags related to orchestration, workflow, CDC, etc.

4. When complete, click the "**Create**" button.  Your application page will be displayed.

After creating the application, you will see a folder structure on the left side of the screen with three main prebuilt folders:

You will have:

* **Resources:** Configure reusable components for orchestration flows.
* **Workflows:** Create and manage different workflows for the application.
* **Schemas:** Handle schema uploads or manage data structure definitions.

This is where you'll define the structure of your integration, including the resources it will interact with, the workflows it will execute, and the schemas it will use.

Now, you can [create a new workflow for your application](../how-to-build-workflows/).
